# World Happiness Report: Data Preprocessing Project

Hi! This project is for my COMP 4353 Data Mining class. Itâ€™s based on the World Happiness Report (2020â€“2024) dataset from Kaggle.

## ðŸ“„ Whatâ€™s Included

- **Alie Bakytbekova13 (1).pdf** â€“ My full data preprocessing report
- **data_preprocessing_script.py** â€“ Python code for all preprocessing steps
- **pca_scatter_plot.png** â€“ PCA visualization showing country clusters
- **gdp_vs_happiness.png** â€“ Linear regression plot (GDP vs Happiness)
- **happiness_score_histogram.png** â€“ Distribution of happiness scores

## ðŸ§ª Techniques I Used

This project covers all 5 major data preprocessing steps:

1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Removed missing values and cleaned column names  
2. **Data Integration** â€“ Combined data from 2020â€“2024 into one dataset  
3. **Data Reduction** â€“ Used PCA and selected key attributes  
4. **Data Transformation** â€“ Normalized data and did discretization  
5. **Data Mining** â€“ Performed clustering, regression, sampling, and created graphs  

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

Everything here was done using Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn). All the graphs and results are based on real processing of the dataset.

Thanks for checking out my work!
