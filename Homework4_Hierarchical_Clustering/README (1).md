# Homework 4: Hierarchical Clustering

This folder contains the code and results for Homework 4 of the Data Mining project.

For Homework 4, Hierarchical Clustering was applied to the normalized World Happiness Report (2020â€“2024) dataset.
The goal was to explore a different clustering technique compared to the K-Means model used in Homework 3.

The dendrogram visualization shows how countries cluster based on happiness-related features like GDP, social support, and health.
